# MalwareDetector
Repository for MalwareDetector [Product built during IEEE Silicon Rush hackathon]

This Malware Detector uses a kaggle dataset containing headers of a PE file 

This Malware Detector uses Static Analysis  which examines the executable or PE file for malicious intent without looking into the file or executing it 
It is straightforward and can be quick to detect the malicious information

This Malware Detector uses a Random Forest Classification which is supervised machine learning algorithm that is widely used in classification problems 
which builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification of the nodes and the decision taken respectively . 
The classifier is made by the help of python and Scikit-learn
